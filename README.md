The vaule can be change.  

```MYVAR="Hello World"```

## Set ENV Var Using Profile

__This is permanent set and if user logged out from terminal or system then it will not remove form system.__

Set Env variable permanent for a user.
- Edit ```~/.profile (ubuntu)```
- Edit ```~/.bash_profile (centos)```

And set variables
- ```export MYVAR=VALUE```
- ```source ~/.profile (to apply immediately)```

Example:

```ls -lt ~/.bash_profile``` (this command is for CentOS)  
```ls -lt ~/.profile``` (this command is for Ubuntu)  

```vi ~/.bash_profile```  
```press i``` for INSERT  
```export NEWVAR=Linux```  

```press Shift+:``` then ```press wq``` and ```ENTER``` for save and exit.  

```cat ~/.bash_profile```  
```echo $NEWVAR```  
```source ~/.bash_profile``` (This command means what user changed, you must proceed to apply)  
```env | grep NEWVAR```  

user now can still access this if he logged out from terminal and relogin it. But one thing that if user open a new tab for terminal then if he typed ```echo $NEWVAR``` but it will not show anything cause it have to set into ```.bashrc``` . It will work for new login shell or terminal. for fixing this issue press command  

```ls -lt ~/.bashrc```  
```vi ~/.bashrc```  
```export NEWVAR=Linux``` then save it  
```source ~/.bashrc```  
```echo $NEWVAR```  

__Warning: Important thing is if user work on a company/production server. If he tried to do this type editing then first he need to backup to the previous file then make this type edit.__
